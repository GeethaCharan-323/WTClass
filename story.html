	In the southern part of Andhra Pradesh there once dwelt an honest family. The family consisted of Ravi Teja, his wife, their 
	little daughter of five years of age.
	
	One night after supper the little girl was seized with a severe fever, and Ravi Teja hurried down town to get some medicine.

	He never came back.
	
	The little girl recovered and in time grew up to womanhood.
	
	The mother grieved very much over her husband's disappearance, and it was nearly three months before she married again, and moved to Ananthapur.
	
	The little girl also married in time, and after a few years had rolled around, she also had a little girl five years of age.
	
	She still lived in the same house where they dwelt when her father had left and never returned.
	
	One night by a remarkable coincidence her little girl was taken with severe fever on the anniversary of the disappearance of Ravi Teja, 
	who would now have been her grandfather if he had been alive and had a steady job.
	
	"I will go downtown and get some medicine for her," said Lokesh (for it was none other than he whom she had married).
	
	"No, no, dear Loki," cried his wife. "You, too, might disappear forever, and then forget to come back."
	
	So Lokesh did not go, and together they sat by the bedside of sweety.
	
	After a little, sweety seemed to grow worse, and Lokesh again attempted to go for medicine, but his wife would not let him.
	
	Suddenly the door opened, and an old man, stooped and bent, with long white hair, entered the room.
	
	"Hello, here is grandpa," said sweety. She had recognized him before any of the others.
	
	The old man drew a bottle of medicine from his pocket and gave sweety a spoonful.
	
	She got well immediately.
	
	"I was a little late," said Ravi Teja, "I forgot the way back home."
